Yash Bhalgat is a research scientist at Qualcomm AI Research. He does algorithm and system design to develop efficient deep networks for computer vision use-cases. Yash has developed pipelines and published papers on low-bit quantization (e.g. LSQ+, QKD), structured and unstructured pruning (e.g. LTP) of deep networks. The usecases Yash has worked on include object detection / classification / segmentation, video segmentation / tracking, gaze estimation, etc. His current research focuses on developing compute-adaptive deep networks.

Yash graduated with a Masters in Computer Science from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. And before that, Yash majored in Electrical Engineering and minored in Computer Science from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), Bombay where he received the Undergraduate Research Award (level 2) for his research on Scattering Wavelet Networks for Fingerprint Classification.
